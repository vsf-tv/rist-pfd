<h1>VSF Payload Format Descriptor Registry</h1>
<p>
<h2>Administrator's Guide</h2>
</center>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This document describes the approval process for a new Payload
  Format Descriptor entry, to be used with RIST Advanced Profile tunnels
  compliant with VSF TR-06-3.</p>

<p>The Payload Format Descriptor is a 32-bit field in the RIST
  Advanced Profile packet header. It provides a hint to the higher
  layers to the contents of the packet. This field is optional for
  tunnel packets that have an inner IP/UDP header, but it is required
  for the low-overhead Direct Payload format. This document assumes
  familiarity with TR-06-3 section 5.2, and in particular section
  5.2.7, which contains the rules for creating the Payload Format
  Descriptor.</p> 

<h2>The Payload Format Descriptor</h2>

<p>The Payload Format Descriptor is a 32-bit field that references a
  particular standard. It is generally divided into the following
  three fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <b>ID Type</b> field, which is a code that identifies the
  standards body from which the format is specified.</li>
  <li>The <b>ID Number</b> field, which identifies the number of the
  individual standard or recommendation. For some standards bodies,
  this field is split into sub-fields, a main document number and a
  part.</li>
  <li>The <b>ID Flavor</b> field, which is used to enumerate multiple
  formats (if present) for the standard or recommendation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The general format of the 32-bit field can be found in Figure 6
  from TR-06-3, reproduced below.</p>

<h2>Approval Process</h2>

<p>The master registry is an Excel spreadsheet, which is a binary
  file. Merging a new entry needs to be done manually. Therefore, new
  submissions to the registry are done through <b>Issues</b>. The
  submitter creates an issue asking for a new registration, and
  including all the necessary fields. The registry administrators
  review the issue, and, if approved, create a PR and update the
  relevant files.</p>

<p>There are two types of registration requests:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Registration requests for an existing <b>ID Type</b>.</li>
  <li>Registration requests that require a new <b>ID Type</b> code for
  a standards body not referenced in TR-06-3.</li>
</ol>

<p>These two request types are handled differently, as described below.</p>

<h3>Registration Requests for an Existing ID Type</h3>

<p>The submitter will use the Excel spreadsheet to compute the Payload
  Format Descriptor, and will include all the from the new spreadsheet
  row in the issue requesting registration. The registry
  administrators will check the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is this request already covered by an existing entry in the
  table? For example, some video compression standards are issued
  jointly by ISO/IEC and ITU. The standard is the same, but it gets a
  different number from each organization.</li>
  <li>Does the proposed standard define a data type or format that can
  be carried over RIST tunnel packets?</li>
  <li>If the proposed standard has multiple formats, the submissal
  must clearly indicate which format it pertains to, and it must set
  the <b>ID Flavor</b> field accordingly. More specifically, the
  first format defined in the standard shall receive <b>ID
  Flavor=0</b>, the second <b>ID Flavor=1</b>, and so on.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the submission passes these checks, it shall be approved, and
  the administrators shall generate a PR to include it in the
  spreadsheet. Once the spreadsheet is updated, the CSV and PDF
  versions shall be re-generated and updated as well.</p>

<h3>Registration Requests for a new ID Type</h3>

<p>The values for the <b>ID Type</b> field are listed in TR-06-3 section
  5.2.7:</p>

<ol start="0">
  <li>VSF</li>
  <li>IETF RFC</li>
  <li>SMPTE</li>
  <li>IEEE</li>
  <li>ISO/IEC</li>
  <li>AES</li>
  <li>ATSC</li>
  <li>ITU</li>
  <li>ETSI/DVB</li>
  <li>EBU</li>
  <li>Reserved</li>
  <li>Reserved</li>
  <li>Reserved</li>
  <li>Reserved</li>
  <li>Reserved</li>
  <li>Vendor-Defined</li>
</ol>

<p>Registration of a new <b>ID Type</b> will need to be approved by
  the RIST AG, since it requires a minor revision of TR-06-3. The
  submitter will need to provide the following information in the
  request:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is there an existing standard that covers this packet format? If
  the answer is yes, justify the need for a new registration.</li>
  <li>Present an use case for new registration.</li>
  <li>Propose the layout of the <b>ID Number</b> field in case the
  standars under consideration have sub-part numbers.</li>
  <li>TR-06-3 has an <b>ID Type</b> reserved for vendor-defined
  codes. Explain why this option is unsuitable.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the RIST AG accepts the request, one of the <b>Reserved</b> fields
  above will be allocated for the standards organization, and the Excel
  spreadsheet will be modified to include this new value. This change
  will be included in the next revision of TR-06-3.</p>
